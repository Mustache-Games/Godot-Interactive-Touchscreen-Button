# Godot Interactive Touchscreen Button
## A custom Godot node that breaks the limits of *ThouchScreenButton* to resize responsively on different screen sizes while maintaining the multi-touch.

**This version will only work on Godot 4.x click here for the Godot 3.x branch.**

**How to use?**
Download the [script](https://github.com/Mustache-Games/Godot-Interactive-Touchscreen-Button/blob/main/interactive_touchscreen_button.gd) and [icon](https://github.com/Mustache-Games/Godot-Interactive-Touchscreen-Button/blob/main/Interactive%20Touchscreen%20Button.svg) then copy them to your project directory, you can put them anywhere inside your project directory but make sure to change the icon path in the [script](https://github.com/Mustache-Games/Godot-Interactive-Touchscreen-Button/blob/main/interactive_touchscreen_button.gd) accordingly.

`@icon("res://Interactive Touchscreen Button.svg")`
